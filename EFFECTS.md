# psysuals — Effects Reference

All effects consume the same shared audio signals. They differ only in how they interpret those signals visually.

---

## Global audio signals

| Signal | Meaning | Source |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `waveform` | Latest raw mono PCM block (`1024` samples) | `sounddevice` callback |
| `fft` | Smoothed, log-scaled spectrum (`512` bins) | Blackman-windowed FFT + EMA |
| `beat` | Normalised beat impulse (`0.0 .. 3.0`) | Spectral flux, optional tracker refinement, main-loop decay |
| `config.MID_ENERGY` | Normalised mid-band energy | Smoothed relative mid-band slice |
| `config.TREBLE_ENERGY` | Normalised treble energy | Smoothed relative treble-band slice |
| `config.BPM` | Live BPM estimate or tap-tempo override | Callback onset timing + optional `librosa` refinement |
| `config.IS_SILENT` | True while silence gate is active | RMS + FFT hysteresis in main loop |

`effect_gain` scales only the foreground beat response. Current default is `0.7`, and changing modes resets it back to that default.

## Hardware Acceleration (ModernGL)

The app supports hardware acceleration via the `--gl` flag. When enabled:
- The app uses ModernGL to offload heavy pixel calculations to the GPU.
- Effects like `Plasma` switch to a GLSL shader-based implementation.
- Other effects continue to draw to a transparent surface that is composited over the GL viewport each frame.
- A fallback system ensures that all effects remain functional even if ModernGL is not installed or the GPU path is disabled.

If no audio input stream is available, the app stays up and the effects simply run against silence until a device is selected.

When `config.IS_SILENT` is true, the runtime suppresses beat spikes and feeds effects low idle motion floors instead of hard zero. That keeps visuals alive during gaps before and after tracks without amplifying the noise floor into fake hits.

Standardized audio energy parameters used across all effects:

| Signal | Source | Typical role |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| `beat` / `bass` | `beat` parameter | kick, sub, pulse, large-scale motion |
| `mid` | `config.MID_ENERGY` | synth body, geometry drift, colour motion, flight speed |
| `high` / `treble` | `config.TREBLE_ENERGY` | shimmer, edges, sparkles, fine detail, high-frequency jitter |

## 1. Yantra

Concentric polygon rings rotate in alternating directions around a bright central hub, with spokes and ring webs building a mandala-like lattice.

- Audio: beat (bass) drives the center dot expansion and ring spring-physics pulses; MID_ENERGY (mids) alternates ring rotations and drives spoke angular wobble; TREBLE_ENERGY (treble) adds high-frequency spoke/vertex jitters and modulates spoke/ring line thicknesses.
- Visual notes: long-lived geometry, strong symmetry, low camera motion, good for steady psytrance passages.

## 2. Cube

Two nested wireframe cubes rotate in 3-D while a pair of small satellite cubes orbit around them on separate trails.

- Audio: beat drives scale expansion and Y-axis rotation; MID_ENERGY drives X-axis rotation velocity and orbit speed; TREBLE_ENERGY drives Z-axis rotation speed, increases satellite rotation speed, and adds physical 3-D vertex jitter to the wireframe.
- Visual notes: the main app now uses the stable CPU implementation again; satellites keep their own persistent trail fade.

## 3. TriFlux

An equilateral triangle wall fills the screen with rainbow wireframe tiles. Selected tiles erupt into the foreground, spin, bounce, and then spring back into place.

- Audio: beat (bass) drives active-tile activation and basic scale pulsing; MID_ENERGY scales background sweep speeds and adds to active-tile scale/brightness; TREBLE_ENERGY accelerates active-tile spin rates and shimmers outline widths.
- Visual notes: two independent sweep bands cross the wall continuously, and the grid extends past screen edges so no clipped borders show.

## 4. Lissajous

A neon 3-D knot traces a dense trail with threefold rotational symmetry and a glowing head point.

- Audio: beat, MID_ENERGY, and TREBLE_ENERGY modulate the X, Y, and Z shape coefficients with reduced influence for a calmer, more fluid motion; MID_ENERGY gently increases rotation speed; TREBLE_ENERGY expands neon glow halos and shimmers trails and node circles.
- Visual notes: motion also reacts to live BPM, so faster tracks tighten and accelerate the knot. Rotation damping is tighter so the knot settles smoothly after beats.

## 5. Tunnel

A first-person ride through a curving polygon tube, with incoming triangles flying toward the viewer from the far end.

- Audio: beat (bass) increases tunnel travel velocity and ring flares; MID_ENERGY modestly drives obstacle spawn rates and rotation speeds; TREBLE_ENERGY drives camera path curvature wobble amplitude and central star size.
- Visual notes: the tube bends continuously, the nearest rings flare hard on strong kicks, and the triangle count is kept lean (max 30 live) so the mid-tunnel stays uncluttered.

## 6. Corridor

Rounded neon frames form a corridor that breathes toward the camera while sparks streak on a separate persistent layer above the geometry.

- Audio: beat drives frame speed and brightness; MID_ENERGY scales camera path sways and frame border inflates; TREBLE_ENERGY drives spark spawn rates, spark sizes, and brightness levels.
- Visual notes: the dedicated spark layer keeps the foreground trails readable instead of smearing them into the walls.

## 7. Nova

Waveform data is mirrored into a sevenfold kaleidoscope across four independently rotating layers.

- Audio: layers are driven by beat, MID_ENERGY, and TREBLE_ENERGY; MID_ENERGY scales layer rotation velocities and outer/inner shapes; TREBLE_ENERGY drives outer-ring radial triangle jitters and waveform line thicknesses.
- Visual notes: this mode is more waveform-shaped than FFT-shaped, so it shows snare and melodic contours clearly.

## 8. Spiral

Six luminous arms sweep toward the viewer as a helix, with cross-ring links tying the structure together into a rotating neon vortex.

- Audio: beat (bass) drives helix speed and spring expansions; MID_ENERGY drives camera path sways and helix radius breathing; TREBLE_ENERGY dynamically twists helix arms and sizes the connection rings.
- Visual notes: colour drift is more aggressive than most modes, which keeps long sessions from feeling static.

## 9. Bubbles

Hundreds of glowing translucent bubbles drift upward with layered halos, reflective highlights, and beat-synchronised global swelling.

- Audio: beat (bass) drives basic bubble scale pulsing, sizes, and mega-bubbles; MID_ENERGY speeds up ascent rates; TREBLE_ENERGY triggers additional bubble spawns and adds horizontal coordinate jitter (wobbles).
- Visual notes: strong beats can trigger exaggerated bloom and larger bubble events, making kicks feel like pressure waves.

## 10. Plasma

Four sine-wave fields interfere into a full-screen psychedelic texture. When running with `--gl`, this effect uses a GLSL fragment shader for per-pixel hardware acceleration.

- Audio: beat (bass) shifts hue and speeds up flow time; MID_ENERGY modulates interference wave density; TREBLE_ENERGY shifts brightness and speeds up cycles.
- Visual notes: this is the primary effect that takes advantage of the ModernGL path, providing high-performance fluid motion. A CPU fallback is automatically used if GL is not available.

## 11. Branches

A recursive lightning tree radiates from the screen centre with multiple branching levels and short trunk stubs, so the structure explodes outward immediately.

- Audio: beat (bass) drives trunk scale and extra arm counts; MID_ENERGY subtly drives branch sway angles and spreads; TREBLE_ENERGY adds modest high-frequency lightning jitter and small branch length decay ratios.
- Visual notes: the tree rotates slowly as a whole. Mid and treble reactivity is deliberately moderate so the structure stays readable even at high energy levels.

## 12. Butterflies

Up to three butterfly pairs move through the screen. A solo butterfly appears first, then a partner joins and the two chase each other in a tightening mutual orbit before occasionally breaking away to wander freely.

- Audio: beat and bass drive wing flapping speed and flight velocities; beat triggers particle sparkles when partners are in close proximity.
- Visual notes: trails are managed on an internal surface so the effect survives backends that do not preserve the display backbuffer between frames. Wing-phase sync is dynamically enabled when partners are near each other.

## 13. FlowField

Twelve thousand+ particles surf a continuously changing multi-layer vector field (scaling dynamically up to 50,000 on high-res displays) and paint the path they take directly into a persistent trail surface.

- Audio: beat (bass) drives particle speeds and field angle scales; MID_ENERGY accelerates field evolution; TREBLE_ENERGY triggers a vectorized center-outward push on particle positions during transients.
- Visual notes: particles now wrap cleanly across the full viewport, so the flow reaches the screen edges without the dark border the old edge recycling created.

## 14. Fireworks

The previous frame is zoomed and darkened into a tunnel while fireworks launch upward and explode into glowing embers.

- Audio: beat (bass) launches rockets and drives zoom scaling; TREBLE_ENERGY dramatically increases rocket explosion ember counts, launch trail widths, and velocities.
- Visual notes: auto-launch timing is also tied to `config.EFFECT_GAIN`, so quieter gain settings create more background rockets between beats.

## 15. Aurora

Five translucent ribbon curtains sweep across the screen as thick parallel bands with additive overlap, bright edge lines, and a cyan-to-violet bias.

- Audio: beat (bass) controls ribbon amplitude and flash triggers; MID_ENERGY drives ribbon thickness and hue shifts; TREBLE_ENERGY drives curtain shimmer phase velocities.
- Visual notes: the effect uses harmonic ribbon stacks rather than particles, so it feels broad and atmospheric.

## 16. Lattice

A dynamic crystal grid of nodes and beams uses a center-out frequency mapping: center columns glow on bass, edge columns glow on treble, creating a symmetric bloom on beats. Grid density scales with display size (14×9 on 1080p, 18×12 on 1440p, 22×14 on 4K+). Features a zoom feedback tunnel and dynamic peak-normalization for balanced column activity.

- Audio: column activity is peak-normalized; beat drives shockwave expansion; MID_ENERGY drives grid feedback rotozoom scales; TREBLE_ENERGY shimmers node base radius and core brightness.
- Visual notes: node hue has a radial offset, so the centre stays cooler while the corners drift more violet. Bass hits now bloom symmetrically outward from both sides of centre.

## 17. Mycelium

A bioluminescent fungal colony simulation featuring rotating satellite node rings orbiting the cores, glowing organic root structures (hyphae), and dynamic swirling spore particles that drift according to a gravity/orbital vector field.

- Audio: bass drives growth speed, core pulsing, and core spore releases; mid controls swirl field motion and branching spread; treble/high frequencies accelerate spore flutter, spore count, and glowing trail brightness; beat seeds new bursts across multiple colony cores.
- Visual notes: growing hyphae tips dynamically shed glowing spores. The cores feature rotating rings of satellite nodes, and the hyphae draw with a soft neon bioluminescent glow style.

## 18. Magnetar

Thousands of particles ride the field lines of an analytically computed rotating magnetic dipole. Particles accumulate near the poles and trace luminous flux lines. Beat fires a shockwave that scatters particles outward from the magnetic equator.

- Audio: bass drives field rotation speed and particle velocity; mid shifts the dipole tilt angle; treble shifts particle colour saturation; beat triggers the equatorial shockwave.
- Visual notes: rendered at half resolution for performance, but particle density now scales much higher on large displays so the field does not thin out on TVs or Android devices.

## 19. SlimeMold

A Physarum-inspired multi-agent simulation: thousands of agents deposit chemical trail, sense three directions, and steer toward the strongest signal. The self-organising vein network pulses and reforms in real time.

- Audio: bass controls agent speed and trail deposit strength; mid sharpens gradient sensitivity; treble widens the sensor angle; beat teleports a fraction of agents back toward centre.
- Visual notes: now runs at a finer internal resolution with smooth scaling, reducing the chunky pixel blocks that were especially obvious on Android.

## 20. Clifford

A 3D-shaded, density-accumulated strange attractor. It runs the Clifford equations at high point density, bins them into a 2D grid using fast `np.bincount`, applies logarithmic scaling for a smooth nebulous look, and shades the result as a 3D relief using bump-mapped diffuse reflection from an orbiting light source.

- Audio: beat jumps to a new curated attractor preset; mid accelerates parameter morphing; bass/beat expands brightness; treble/high frequencies drive hue shifting and detail.
- Visual notes: features dynamic percentile framing to keep the attractor scaled properly. The 3D relief shading makes the fractal ribbons look like sculpted metallic/glassy structures morphing in space.

## 21. Möbius

A 3-D Möbius strip rendered as a wireframe with perspective projection. The visible structure is now carried by the latitude loops alone, leaving the band clean instead of cutting it up with interior cross-lines.

- Audio: bass controls rotation speed; mid controls roll/tilt speed; treble accelerates hue drift along the strip; beat triggers the shiver.
- Visual notes: hue varies continuously along the strip width, highlighting the non-orientable topology without the straight interior wires.

## 22. Chromatic

Prismatic raindrop ripples expand from beat origins as wavy RGB-separated outlines rather than plain circles, producing chromatic interference that reads cleanly on Android.

- Audio: bass controls expansion speed and ring intensity; mid drives ripple drift; treble increases the RGB split and wave deformation; beat spawns new droplets.
- Visual notes: the rings are intentionally irregular and fluid, so the effect reads as chromatic rainfall instead of concentric circles.

## 23. Persistence

Multiple nested polygons rotate in 3D space on non-coplanar X, Y, and Z axes at different speeds. Projected through a perspective camera with depth-based thickness and brightness shading, their counter-rotating ghost images accumulate under long persistence to form 3D holographic moiré mandalas.

- Audio: bass drives X/Y/Z rotation speed bursts; mid scales the number of active shapes; treble fires a radial flash ring in background; beat triggers a speed spike and hue jump.
- Visual notes: lines closer to the camera are drawn thicker and brighter, creating realistic 3D depth cueing as the polygons spin in perspective.

## 24. Synapse

~55 nodes wired to their nearest neighbours form a neural graph. Signals travel visibly along edges as glowing pulses; arriving signals fire destination nodes which cascade further. Beat triggers multi-node cascades.

- Audio: bass drives signal propagation speed and node glow intensity; mid controls the baseline auto-fire rate; treble increases signal color saturation; beat fires bounded multi-node cascades.
- Visual notes: the live signal pool is now capped and node fan-out is sampled instead of fully expanded, keeping the effect stable on Android and other lower-power targets.

## 25. Heartbeat

Rhythmic pressure waves expand from the screen centre. Each beat spawns concentric rings whose outline morphs between a circle (gentle bass) and a polygon (heavy bass). Multiple overlapping rings create moiré interference patterns.

- Audio: bass drives wave speed and polygon morphing (low bass = circle, high bass = triangle); mid modulates propagation speed; treble adds shimmer; beat spawns new ring(s).
- Visual notes: strong beats at high bass produce stark polygonal shockwaves; gentle beats produce soft circular ripples. Rings are drawn with polygon outlines for smooth morphing.

## 26. Spectrum

Classic analyser bars are spaced logarithmically, with peak markers and a waveform line layered over the centre of the screen.

- Audio: per-bin FFT controls bar height; beat drives bar smoothing decay; MID_ENERGY shifts base hue; TREBLE_ENERGY modulates waveform overlay line thickness and vertical amplitude.
- Visual notes: this is the plainest diagnostic mode and is useful for checking input levels quickly.

## 27. Waterfall

A scrolling spectrogram stores recent history as rows, with hue encoding frequency and brightness encoding energy.

- Audio: FFT energy fills scrolling rows; beat/mids add row brightness boosts; TREBLE_ENERGY adds a heat-shimmer jitter/offset to newly scrolled rows.
- Visual notes: because it accumulates history, this is the best mode for spotting rhythmic patterns and sustained tonal bands.
